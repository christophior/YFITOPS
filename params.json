{"name":"YFITOPS","tagline":"Small app to download Spotify tracks and playlists","body":"YFITOPS\r\n===========\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/christophior/yfitops.git\r\ncd yfitops\r\nnpm install\r\nsudo easy_install pip\r\nsudo pip install eyeD3\r\n\r\n# setup\r\nnode app.js config\r\n\r\n# run\r\nnode app.js <spotify uri>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\nBefore being able to run the script you will need to do some configuration.\r\n\r\nTo automate this configuration you can run\r\n```\r\nnode app.js config\r\n```\r\nThis will allow you to generate a **config.json** file in the config folder with your Spotify username, encrypted Spotify password (just so that it's not in plain text locally) and your download path.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do this manually that can also be done so but you will need to either leave your password in plain text or implement your own encryption/decryption.\r\n\r\nI believe the default Music folder location in Mac's is **/Users/USERNAME/Music** so that might be a good location to use. I would recommend making sure you only keep your **config/config.json** file in your local machine.\r\n\r\n** **to be able to use the script I believe you need to have a Spotify Premium account** **\r\n\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nRunning on the current node version seems to not work properly but [Node v0.10.36](http://blog.nodejs.org/2015/01/26/node-v0-10-36-stable/) works fine. \r\n\r\nTo download Node0.10.36 just go to [http://blog.nodejs.org/2015/01/26/node-v0-10-36-stable/](http://blog.nodejs.org/2015/01/26/node-v0-10-36-stable/) and download/install the appropriate version based on your machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce you have your config file and Node 0.10.36 you can just do the following to start using the app\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode app.js <spotify uri>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn output showing the progress of the app will be displayed. If an error occurs or the script fails to quit you can always use ctrl+c to kill the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Spotify URIs\r\nThe application expects a Spotify URI at run time. To grab the URI of a song or playlist you can either right-click on a song or playlist in the Spotify app to copy the URI to your clipboard.\r\n\r\n## eyeD3\r\neyeD3 is used to id3 tag the song files with artist and album info. Aside from this info the album artwork is also updated on the song. Eyed3 can be downloaded using pip (which can be downloaded using easy_install).\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo easy_install pip\r\nsudo pip install eyeD3\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tips\r\nA great way to make this app easier to use is to set an alias up in your .bash_profile. You can run the following:\r\n```\r\nvim ~/.bash_profile\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will open up an editor to edit your .bash_profile file, once open just add an alias line that follows the following format\r\n\r\nalias command='original command to run'\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nalias download='node /Users/Chris/Development/yfitops/app.js'\r\n```\r\nAfter this just save and exit the editor by typing ESC followed by :wq and your new command will be saved. If you try running the new command (you might have to exit and re-enter your terminal) you should see the familar output from the app.\r\n\r\nEx.\r\n```\r\ndownload\r\n# output\r\nPlease pass in a Spotify URI\r\n\r\n# let's try that again\r\ndownload spotify:track:2sNvitW3TxiTeC9xT9f2ZZ\r\n# output\r\nGiven URI is a Spotify track...\r\n\tDownloading: Kygo - Firestone.mp3\r\n```\r\n\r\n# to prevent config file from being pushed\r\n```\r\ngit update-index --assume-unchanged config/config.json\r\n# to undo this\r\ngit update-index --no-assume-unchanged config/config.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\nThis application was created to gain knowledge in Node and Javascript.\r\nUsing the script is very likely to be a breach of the Spotify End User Agreement:\r\n\r\n> Spotify respects intellectual property rights and expects you to do the same.
